# Regression Model Improvement

This repository contains R scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data for improving the performance of a baseline regression model.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to improve the performance of a baseline regression model by adding polynomial terms, interaction terms, and regularization terms. The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Add polynomial terms**
2. **Add interactions terms**
3. **Add regularizations terms**
4. **Experiment to search for improved models**

## Files

- `r.R`: This R script contains the code for improving the regression model.
- `lab-jupyter-linear-models-refinments.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the same code as the R script but in a notebook format which allows for a more interactive experience.
- `model_results_df.csv`: This CSV file contains the data used for building and improving the regression model.

## Usage

To run the R script, you need to have R and the `tidymodels` `tidyverse` `stringr`  package installed. You can then clone this repository and run `regression_model_improvement.R` in R.

To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then clone this repository and open `regression_model_improvement.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
