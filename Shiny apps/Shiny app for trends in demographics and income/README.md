# Shiny App for Adult Data Analysis

This repository contains an R script for a Shiny App that provides an interactive analysis of the Adult dataset.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a Shiny App that allows users to explore the Adult dataset. The app provides options for the user to select a country and a variable of interest. Depending on the user's selections, the app will display a histogram or boxplot for a continuous variable, or a faceted or stacked bar chart for a categorical variable.

## Files

- `app.R`: This R script contains the server-side code for the Shiny App. It includes functions for reading the data, processing the data based on user input, and rendering the appropriate plots.

## Usage

To run the Shiny App, you need to have R and the `shiny` and `tidyverse` packages installed. You can then clone this repository and run `app.R` in R.
