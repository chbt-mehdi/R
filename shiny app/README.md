# Shiny App for Weather Forecast

This repository contains an R script for a Shiny App that provides weather forecasts for various cities.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a Shiny App that fetches and displays weather forecast data for a list of cities. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the forecast data, which includes weather conditions, temperature, visibility, humidity, and wind speed. The forecast data is then visualized in the Shiny App.

## Files

- `model_prediction.R`: This R script contains the code for making predictions with the trained model.
- `selected_cities.csv`: This CSV file contains a list of cities for which the weather forecast is made.
- `server.R`: This R script contains the server-side code for the Shiny App that displays the weather forecasts.
- `ui.R`: This R script contains the UI code for the Shiny App that displays the weather forecasts.

## Usage

To run the Shiny App, you need to have R and the `shiny` package installed. You also need to have an API key for the OpenWeatherMap API. You can then clone this repository and run `app.R` in R.
