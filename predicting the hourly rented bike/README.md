# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This repository contains R scripts and Jupyter notebooks for predicting the hourly rented bike count using related weather and date information.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build predictive models to predict the hourly rented bike count. The models are built using `tidymodels` in R and include baseline linear regression models. The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Split data into training and testing datasets**
2. **Build a linear regression model using only the weather variables**
3. **Build a linear regression model using both weather and date variables**
4. **Evaluate the models and identify important variables**

## Files

- `R jupyter-linear-models-baselinse.R`: This R script contains the code for building and evaluating the models.
- `lab-jupyter-linear-models-baselinse.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the same code as the R script but in a notebook format which allows for a more interactive experience.

## Usage

To run the R script, you need to have R and the `tidymodels` package installed. You can then clone this repository and run `bike_sharing_demand.R` in R.

To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then clone this repository and open `bike_sharing_demand.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
